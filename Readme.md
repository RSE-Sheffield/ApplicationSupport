#  Applications support for CiCS

This repository contains the installation instructions for various applications available at The University of Sheffield CiCS software download system. The main aim is to keep the applications and installation procedures updated regularly.

The following outputs are required for each application:

## Front page for https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cics/software/available

Contains very basic information:
- Function
- Eligibility
- Versions
- Getting the Software

This needs to be emailed to Rosemary Snowden at CiCS (link to .md file in the repository).


## Detailed information for the application download

The information should be provided in a .txt file as this information is sent via email. This document should contain more detailed information than the Front Page document i.e.
- License details
- Versions available and OS supported
- Eligibility
- Packages contained in the application (if applicable)
- Installation and licensing instructions

 In special cases .pdf files containing detailed installation/integration instructions might be required.

 The .txt and .pdf files should be emailed to Peter Armstrong at CiCS.

## The application that needs to be installed
 The person in charge should find an appropriate means to share the iso/binary files with Peter Armstrong (e.g. Dropbox, make sure to delete the folder after Peter has downloaded the file).

## Applications currently supported by the RSE team:

- Abaqus
- Intel XE Compilers (C/C++, Fortran)
- Mathematica
- PGI Compilers
- Maple
- NAG libraries and compilers
