## Licensing notes
Intel Compilers are licensed using network based license at the University of Sheffield. Therefore, you need to be connected to the University network for both installation of the software and during compilation of source code (not when running your executables). If working off-site you need to be connected to the University VPN client.

Our current license supports 5 Windows, 5 Linux, and 2 Mac OS X concurrent compilations site-wide. Due to the limited number of network licenses available this compiler is suitable for research purposes only (i.e. **not suitable for teaching use**).

## Getting the software
The latest version of the Intel C++ Compiler can be obtained via the [Software download service](https://cics.dept.shef.ac.uk/software/).
