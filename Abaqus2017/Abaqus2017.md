# Abaqus 2017

## Function
The Abaqus unified FEA provides powerful and complete solutions for both routine and sophisticated engineering problems over a broad spectrum of industrial and research applications.
The Abaqus products suites consists of the following software products:
* **Abaqus CAE:** is a complete solution for Abaqus finite element modeling, visualization and process automation. It allows the user to efficiently create, edit, monitor, diagnose, and visualize advanced Abaqus analysis. The intuitive interface provides an easy-to-use environment for new users.
* **Abaqus/Standard:** is an implicit non-linear solver for static and structural low-speed dynamic events.
* **Abaqus/Explicit:** is an explicit solver for transient dynamic events. It is well suited to simulate brief transient dynamic events such as crahs analysis, drop-tetsing, or ballistic impact.
* **Abaqus/CFD:** provides advanced computational fluid dynamics capabilities

## Elegibility
* All members of the University of Sheffield, for academic purposes
* Not NHS, Honorary or retired staff

## Versions
The University of has licenses for the latest version of Abaqus unified FEA suite: Abaqus 2017 (Windows and Linux).
Such version can only be installed on university owned computers.

**The Abaqus Student Edition (SE)** is free of charge for students, researchers, and educators with a DS Passport associated with an academic institution.

The Abaqus SE is available for Windows platforms only and supports structural models up to 1000 nodes and CFD models to 10,000 nodes.

The Abaqus SE can be downloaded from the [3DS academy](https://academy.3ds.com/en/software/abaqus-student-edition).

## System requirements
 Minimum system requirements and supported operative systems can be found [here](http://www.3ds.com/support/certified-hardware/simulia-system-information/) as well as a list of [tested graphic devices](http://www.3ds.com/support/certified-hardware/simulia-system-information/abaqus-2016/abaqus-2016-graphics-devices/). To access some of the information on the 3DS website you need to create a DS Passport using your sheffield.ac.uk email.

  If you intend to implement user subroutines and/or user-written postprocessing programs you need to install the Fortran and C++ compilers. Such compilers can be obtained via the [Software download service](https://cics.dept.shef.ac.uk/software/).

  Raid directories are not currently supported for Abaqus installation. Operative systems such as Vista & XP as well as most popular linux distributions are excluded from the list of supported OS. It might be possible to install Abaqus on unsupported OS and directories but it should be done at your discretion.

## Licensing
Abaqus is licensed using network based licenses at the University of Sheffield. Therefore, you need to be connected to the University network during installation and use of the software.

There are ***** CAE and ***** analysis license tokens available at the University. In general Abaqus CAE uses 1 CAE token. For analysis jobs the numbers of tokens used depends on the number of **CPU cores** and GPUS (where 1 GPU=1 CPU). Then numbers of tokens required for a certain job to run on N CPU's or cores can be computed as: INT(5 x N^0.422).


## Getting the software
The latest version of the Intel Fortran Compiler can be obtained via the [Software download service](https://cics.dept.shef.ac.uk/software/).
